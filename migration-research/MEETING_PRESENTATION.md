## 🔴 Slide 3: Critical Gaps (Must Address)

### Top 5 Gaps Blocking Partner Success

| Gap | Impact | Why Critical |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| **1. Code Examples** | 🔴 High | Partners need working samples to copy |
| **2. Testing Framework** | 🔴 High | No way to validate migration success |
| **3. Partner Assessment** | 🔴 High | Don't know who's ready to migrate |
| **4. Rollback Procedures** | 🔴 High | Safety net for production migrations |
| **5. Training Materials** | 🟡 Medium | Team enablement and ramp-up |

### Current State
- ✅ **Guidance**: We have it (documentation complete)
- ❌ **Tooling**: We don't have it (examples, testing, assessment)
- ❌ **Process**: We don't have it (rollback, training, support)

## Answers to Anticipated Questions

**Q**: "Why not use existing examples?"  
**A**: Existing examples are scattered, not migration-focused. We need before/after comparisons.

**Q**: "Can we do this with current team?"  
**A**: Current team created the foundation. Scaling requires dedicated resources.

**Q**: "What if partners wait?"  
**A**: Framework is production-ready now. Delays mean partners miss benefits.

**Q**: "What about community contributions?"  
**A**: Welcome, but partners need official guidance. Can't rely on community alone.

**Q**: "How do we measure success?"  
**A**: Partner adoption rate, migration time, support ticket volume, satisfaction scores.
