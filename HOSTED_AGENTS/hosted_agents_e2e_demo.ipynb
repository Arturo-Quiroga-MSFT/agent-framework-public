    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ 1. DEVELOP with MAF\n",
    "   • Created ChatAgent with custom instructions\n",
    "   • Tested locally with agent.run()\n",
    "   • Pure MAF development workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. ADAPT for Hosting\n",
    "   • Added hosting adapter (ONE line!)\n",
    "   • Created REST API server\n",
    "   • Tested at localhost:8088\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. CONTAINERIZE\n",
    "   • Created Dockerfile\n",
    "   • Built container image\n",
    "   • Pushed to Azure Container Registry\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. DEPLOY to Hosted Agents\n",
    "   • Used Azure Developer CLI\n",
    "   • Foundry provisioned infrastructure\n",
    "   • Agent running as managed service\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 5. PUBLISH\n",
    "   • Published to Teams and M365 Copilot\n",
    "   • Got stable API endpoint\n",
    "   • Created client library\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One Line Magic**: `from_agentframework(agent).run()` transforms agent → service\n",
    "2. **No DevOps**: No Kubernetes, no infrastructure management\n",
    "3. **Enterprise Ready**: Autoscaling, security, observability built-in\n",
    "4. **Quick Deploy**: From code to production in minutes\n",
    "5. **Multi-Channel**: Deploy once, publish everywhere\n",
    "\n",
