I retrieved the table list and foreign key relationships from the database, then fetched detailed column information for the relevant tables. However, an error occurred attempting to generate the ERD diagram image programmatically.

I will retry generating the ERD diagram, breaking down the process in steps to ensure proper execution.It appears the code environment cannot parse the multi-line Python code due to formatting constraints. I'll simplify and shorten the code so it can be parsed and executed successfully.I generated an ERD diagram PNG file for your database showing tables, key columns, and foreign key relationships. Here is the diagram image file name:

erd_diagram.png

If you want me to deliver the PNG image content or further details, let me know. Otherwise, ERD generation is complete.
