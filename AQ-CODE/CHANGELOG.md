# Changelog - Agent Framework Streamlit Demo

All notable changes to the Streamlit demo application are documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-26

### üéâ Major New Features

#### Conversation Memory (Thread Persistence)
- **Added conversation memory to 4 scenarios**: Thread Management, Azure AI Search, Bing Grounding, and File Search
- **Session-based thread persistence**: Conversations maintain context across multiple messages
- **User-controlled memory**: "Clear Conversation Memory" buttons allow users to reset context
- **Seamless follow-up questions**: "Tell me more about that" and similar queries reference previous responses
- **Technical implementation**: Thread IDs stored in `st.session_state`, reused via `agent.get_new_thread(service_thread_id=...)`

**Scenarios with Memory:**
- ‚úÖ Thread Management (built-in framework feature)
- ‚úÖ Azure AI Search (hotel searches with context)
- ‚úÖ Bing Grounding (web searches with follow-ups)
- ‚úÖ File Search (document Q&A with context)

**Remaining scenarios (planned for future releases):**
- ‚è≥ Basic Chat
- ‚è≥ Weather Agent
- ‚è≥ Code Interpreter
- ‚è≥ Firecrawl MCP
- ‚è≥ Microsoft Learn MCP

#### Plot Download Button
- **Instant plot downloads**: One-click PNG download for Code Interpreter visualizations
- **No external storage needed**: Direct browser downloads via `st.download_button()`
- **Works in all environments**: Local development and Azure Container Apps
- **Automatic detection**: Finds latest generated plot in `/app/generated_plots/`
- **User-friendly**: Download button appears immediately after plot generation

#### Automated Azure Deployment
- **One-command deployment**: New `deploy-to-azure.sh` script automates entire deployment
- **Timestamp-based versioning**: Images tagged with `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` format (e.g., `20251026-211128`)

## Migration Notes

### From v1.1.0 to v1.2.0

**Breaking Changes:**
- None! All changes are backward compatible.

**New Requirements:**
- Azure Managed Identity must be configured for production deployments
- "Cognitive Services User" role must be assigned to MI principal

**Migration Steps:**
1. Update to latest code: `git pull`
2. Redeploy using new script: `cd AQ-CODE && bash deploy-to-azure.sh`
3. Verify Managed Identity is enabled and has correct role
4. Test memory features in Azure AI Search, Bing, and File Search scenarios
5. Test plot download button in Code Interpreter

**Rollback:**
If needed, redeploy previous version:
```bash
az containerapp update \
  --name agent-framework-demo \
  --resource-group agent-framework-rg \
  --image aqr2d2agentframeworkacr007.azurecr.io/agent-framework-demo:20251025-HHMMSS
```
