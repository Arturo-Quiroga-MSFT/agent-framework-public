Customer Onboarding & KYC Automation Workflow - DevUI Version with Tracing

This workflow creates an intelligent customer onboarding pipeline that combines
sequential decision-making with parallel verification processes to automate
Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance and account setup.

The workflow uses a hybrid pattern:
- Sequential intake and triage stages
- Parallel verification processes (documents, credit, compliance)
- Sequential risk assessment and account setup
- Final parallel notifications

WORKFLOW STAGES:
1. Initial Intake: Customer data collection and validation
2. Risk Triage: Preliminary risk scoring and routing decision
3. PARALLEL VERIFICATION:
   - Document Verification: ID, proof of address, business documents
   - Credit Assessment: Credit score, financial history, debt analysis
   - Compliance Screening: AML, sanctions lists, PEP checks
4. Risk Assessment: Aggregate verification results and final risk score
5. Account Configuration: Product selection, limits, features
6. Welcome Package: Account credentials, documentation, next steps

ONBOARDING AGENTS:
1. Intake Specialist: Data collection, form validation, completeness check
2. Risk Triage Agent: Preliminary risk scoring, routing decision (standard/enhanced due diligence)
3. Document Verification Agent: ID verification, OCR, fraud detection
4. Credit Assessment Agent: Credit scoring, financial analysis, debt ratios
5. Compliance Screening Agent: AML checks, sanctions lists, PEP screening
6. Risk Assessment Agent: Aggregate results, final risk score, approval decision
7. Account Setup Agent: Product configuration, limits, features, credentials
8. Communications Agent: Welcome package, documentation, onboarding guide

PREREQUISITES:
- Azure OpenAI access configured via .env file in workflows directory
- Azure CLI authentication: Run 'az login'

TRACING OPTIONS:
1. Console Tracing: Set ENABLE_CONSOLE_TRACING=true (simplest)
2. Azure AI Tracing: Set ENABLE_AZURE_AI_TRACING=true (requires Application Insights)
3. OTLP Tracing: Set OTLP_ENDPOINT (e.g., http://localhost:4317 for Jaeger/Zipkin)
4. DevUI Tracing: Set ENABLE_DEVUI_TRACING=true (view in DevUI interface)
