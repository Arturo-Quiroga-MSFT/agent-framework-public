# ML Model Productionization Gate Review Workflow

## Overview

A sequential gate review workflow that evaluates ML/AI models for production readiness through 7 ordered specialist gates. Each gate builds on previous findings to create a comprehensive production readiness assessment with gate table and recommendations.

## Workflow Pattern

**Type:** Sequential (Ordered Chain)  
**Gates:** 7 specialized production readiness reviewers  
**Processing:** Each gate sees full conversation history and appends structured findings  
**Output:** Consolidated report with gate table, risks, and Go/No-Go recommendation

## Production Readiness Criteria

### Gate Status Definitions

|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Pass** | Gate criteria fully met | Proceed to next gate |
| **Conditional** | Minor issues, can address in parallel | Document risks, create mitigation plan |
| **Fail** | Critical issues, blocker | Must resolve before production |

### Common Failure Modes

**Problem Framing:**
- ❌ Vague business objectives, unclear KPIs
- ❌ Success criteria not measurable
- ❌ Scope creep, unrealistic expectations

**Data Readiness:**
- ❌ Insufficient training data volume
- ❌ Severe class imbalance (99%+ skew)
- ❌ High missingness (>30% in key features)
- ❌ No labeling quality control process

**Feature Engineering:**
- ❌ Data leakage (future information in features)
- ❌ Target leakage (proxy for target in features)
- ❌ Unclear feature transformations
- ❌ No feature importance analysis

**Model Performance:**
- ❌ Metrics don't align to KPIs
- ❌ Overfitting (train/val gap >10%)
- ❌ No validation strategy (single train/test split)
- ❌ No error analysis or failure mode understanding

**Responsible AI:**
- ❌ No fairness assessment for sensitive groups
- ❌ Unmitigated bias in training data
- ❌ Potential harm scenarios not identified
- ❌ No governance or review process

**Security & Robustness:**
- ❌ No threat model or adversarial assessment
- ❌ Model artifacts not integrity-checked
- ❌ Secrets hardcoded in code
- ❌ No input validation or sanitization

**Deployment & Monitoring:**
- ❌ No rollout strategy (big-bang deployment)
- ❌ No drift detection or retraining plan
- ❌ No alerting or on-call ownership
- ❌ No rollback plan

## ML Lifecycle Best Practices

### Data Quality Checks
```python
# Minimum data quality gates
- Volume: >= 10K samples per class (for supervised learning)
- Balance: No class < 5% of dataset (or use stratified sampling)
- Completeness: <10% missing values in critical features
- Freshness: Data < 6 months old (for time-sensitive domains)
- Consistency: Schema matches production data sources
```

### Model Validation Strategy
```python
# Recommended validation approach
- Time-based split: Train on older data, validate on newer
- Cross-validation: 5-fold or 10-fold for robustness
- Holdout test: 20% held out, never used in training
- Out-of-distribution test: Test on data from different geography/time
```

### Fairness Metrics
```python
# Common fairness metrics by use case
- Demographic Parity: P(ŷ=1|A=0) ≈ P(ŷ=1|A=1)
- Equalized Odds: TPR and FPR equal across groups
- Calibration: P(y=1|ŷ=p, A) equal across groups
- Individual Fairness: Similar individuals get similar predictions
```

### Monitoring Strategy
```python
# Production monitoring metrics
- Latency: p50, p95, p99 prediction latency
- Throughput: Requests per second
- Data Drift: KL divergence, PSI (Population Stability Index)
- Concept Drift: Model accuracy over time
- Feature Drift: Per-feature distribution shifts
- Business Metrics: KPIs (conversion rate, revenue, churn)
```

## Gate Review Checklist

### Pre-Review Preparation
- [ ] Model card or documentation prepared
- [ ] Training/validation data available for inspection
- [ ] Evaluation metrics computed on holdout test set
- [ ] Stakeholders identified (product, legal, security)
- [ ] Production environment architecture documented

### During Review
- [ ] All 7 gates completed sequentially
- [ ] Risks documented with severity (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Mitigations proposed with owners and timelines
- [ ] Conditional gates have documented resolution plans
- [ ] Executive summary captures key decision points

### Post-Review Actions
- [ ] Gate table shared with stakeholders
- [ ] Conditional/Fail gates assigned to owners
- [ ] Re-review scheduled if major changes needed
- [ ] Production deployment plan approved
- [ ] Post-launch review date set (30/60/90 days)

## Sequential vs Concurrent

**Why Sequential for Gate Review?**
- ✅ Each gate builds on previous findings (cumulative context)
- ✅ Later gates (security, deployment) need to know earlier decisions
- ✅ Mimics real-world production readiness review process
- ✅ Allows for iterative refinement at each stage

**When to Use Concurrent Instead:**
- Each perspective is independent (no dependencies)
- Need rapid results from all experts simultaneously
- Simulating a cross-functional team meeting
- Example: Product launch analysis (researcher, marketer, legal, finance)

## Tracing Options

Set environment variables to enable tracing:

- **Console:** `ENABLE_CONSOLE_TRACING=true`
- **Application Insights:** `ENABLE_AZURE_AI_TRACING=true`
- **OTLP Endpoint:** `OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317`
- **DevUI Tracing:** `ENABLE_DEVUI_TRACING=true`

## Related Workflows

- **Clinical Trial Management:** Similar gate review pattern for clinical trials
- **Biotech IP Landscape:** Synthesis step after concurrent analysis
- **Cybersecurity Incident:** Time-boxed response prioritization

## Port Configuration

Default port: **8099**

To change the port, modify the `port` parameter in the `serve()` call:
```python
serve(entities=[workflow], port=8100, auto_open=True)
```

## Entity ID

Workflow entity ID: **`workflow_ml_prod_sequential`**

Used for API calls and DevUI identification.

## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **This workflow generates preliminary production readiness assessment for planning purposes only.**

- **Not Model Governance** - Establish formal model governance board
- **Not Bias Audit** - Conduct thorough fairness audits with domain experts
- **Not Security Assessment** - Engage security teams for threat modeling
- **Not Legal Advice** - Consult legal counsel for regulatory compliance
- **Validation Required** - All gate findings must be validated by human experts
- **Context Dependent** - Risk thresholds vary by industry and use case

## Best Practices

### Input Quality
- **Be Specific:** Include model type, use case, data sources, target KPIs
- **Provide Context:** User population, deployment environment, constraints
- **Set Expectations:** Accuracy targets, latency requirements, business impact

### Output Interpretation
- **Prioritize Risks:** Address High severity risks before Conditional Go
- **Validate Assumptions:** Gates make assumptions; verify with domain knowledge
- **Iterate:** Use initial review to improve model and rerun gates

### When to Re-Run
- Major model architecture change
- Significant data source or feature changes
- New regulatory requirements emerge
- Production performance degrades (drift, accuracy drop)

## Production Deployment Stages

| Stage | Purpose | Duration | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Canary** | Test on 5% of traffic | 1-3 days | No degradation in KPIs |
| **Gradual Rollout** | Ramp 5%→25%→50%→100% | 1-2 weeks | Metrics stable at each stage |
| **Full Production** | 100% of traffic | Ongoing | Meets SLOs, KPIs improving |
| **Post-Launch Review** | Assess impact | 30/60/90 days | KPIs vs baseline, lessons learned |

## MLOps Maturity Model

| Level | Characteristics | Gate Review Frequency |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Level 0:** Manual | Ad-hoc experiments, no automation | Before each deployment |
| **Level 1:** Automated Training | Training pipeline automated | Before major versions |
| **Level 2:** Automated Deployment | CI/CD for models | Quarterly reviews |
| **Level 3:** Full MLOps | Automated monitoring, retraining | Annual reviews + audits |
