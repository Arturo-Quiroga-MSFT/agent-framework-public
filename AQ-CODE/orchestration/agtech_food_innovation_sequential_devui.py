AgTech/Food Innovation Sequential Workflow - DevUI Version with Tracing

This workflow creates a sequential pipeline of 7 AgTech/food innovation experts who
build upon each other's analysis in a specific order to provide comprehensive insights.

The workflow uses a sequential pattern where:
- User describes an AgTech or food innovation concept
- Each agent processes the full conversation history sequentially
- Agents build upon previous agents' insights
- Results flow through the pipeline: Agronomy → Engineering → Food Science → 
  Sustainability → Economics → Supply Chain → Regulations

AGTECH AGENTS (Sequential Order):
1. Agronomy Specialist: Crop science, yield optimization, soil health
2. AgTech Engineer: Automation, robotics, AI/ML, precision agriculture
3. Food Science: Nutrition, taste, texture, shelf life, food safety
4. Sustainability: Water usage, emissions, biodiversity, regenerative practices
5. Ag Economics: Farm adoption, pricing, subsidies, market access
6. Supply Chain & Distribution: Cold chain, logistics, retail partnerships
7. Food Regulations: FDA, USDA, organic certification, labeling

PREREQUISITES:
- Azure OpenAI access configured via .env file in workflows directory
- Azure CLI authentication: Run 'az login'

TRACING OPTIONS:
1. Console Tracing: Set ENABLE_CONSOLE_TRACING=true (simplest)
2. Azure AI Tracing: Set ENABLE_AZURE_AI_TRACING=true (requires Application Insights)
3. OTLP Tracing: Set OTLP_ENDPOINT (e.g., http://localhost:4317 for Jaeger/Zipkin)
4. DevUI Tracing: Set ENABLE_DEVUI_TRACING=true (view in DevUI interface)
