"""
Clinical Trial Management Workflow - DevUI Version with Tracing

This workflow creates a specialized team of 7 clinical trial experts to analyze
pharmaceutical trials, medical device studies, and clinical research programs.

The workflow uses a fan-out/fan-in pattern where:
- User describes a clinical trial or study
- Input is dispatched to all 7 specialized agents concurrently
- Each agent provides domain-specific analysis
- Results are aggregated and formatted with clear sections

CLINICAL TRIAL AGENTS:
- Clinical Research: Protocol design, endpoints, statistical power
- Site Operations: Patient recruitment, site selection, monitoring
- Regulatory Affairs: FDA submissions, IRB, adverse event reporting
- Drug Development: Dosing, pharmacokinetics, formulation
- Clinical Finance: Budget, CRO contracts, patient compensation
- Biostatistics & Data: Data management, interim analysis, endpoints
- Patient Advocacy: Informed consent, diversity, patient experience

PREREQUISITES:
- Azure OpenAI access configured via .env file in workflows directory
- Azure CLI authentication: Run 'az login'

TRACING OPTIONS:
1. Console Tracing: Set ENABLE_CONSOLE_TRACING=true (simplest)
2. Azure AI Tracing: Set ENABLE_AZURE_AI_TRACING=true (requires Application Insights)
3. OTLP Tracing: Set OTLP_ENDPOINT (e.g., http://localhost:4317 for Jaeger/Zipkin)
4. DevUI Tracing: Set ENABLE_DEVUI_TRACING=true (view in DevUI interface)
