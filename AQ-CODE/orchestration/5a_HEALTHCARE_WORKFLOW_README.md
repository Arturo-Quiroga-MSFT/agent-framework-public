# Healthcare Product Launch Workflow

## Overview

A concurrent fan-out/fan-in workflow that analyzes healthcare products, medical devices, and health services through 5 specialized healthcare experts. All agents process the input simultaneously and their insights are aggregated into a comprehensive analysis.

## Workflow Pattern

**Type:** Concurrent (Fan-out/Fan-in)  
**Agents:** 5 specialized healthcare domain experts  
**Processing:** All agents analyze input in parallel, results aggregated at the end

## Agent Specializations

1. **🔬 Clinical Research & Evidence**
   - Clinical trial requirements, evidence standards
   - Efficacy metrics, patient outcomes, safety profiles
   - Adverse events, contraindications, peer-reviewed research

2. **📋 Healthcare Compliance & Regulatory**
   - FDA classification (510k, PMA, De Novo)
   - HIPAA privacy rules, medical device regulations
   - Clinical trial requirements (IRB approval), international standards (CE mark, ISO 13485)

3. **💰 Healthcare Economics & Reimbursement**
   - Insurance coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, private payers)
   - CPT/HCPCS codes, value-based care models
   - Cost-effectiveness analysis (QALY), pricing strategies

4. **👥 Patient Experience & Safety**
   - Health literacy requirements, accessibility standards (ADA, WCAG)
   - Patient journey mapping, cultural competency
   - Usability testing, patient safety protocols

5. **🔐 Medical Data Security & Privacy**
   - HIPAA Security Rule requirements, PHI protection
   - Encryption standards, access controls, audit logging
   - Cloud security (HITRUST, SOC 2), Business Associate Agreements (BAA)

## Use Cases

### Medical Devices
- AI-powered diagnostic tools (diabetic retinopathy, lung nodule detection)
- Wearable cardiac monitors with real-time alerts
- Smart insulin pumps with automated glucose management
- Remote patient monitoring devices

### Digital Health
- Telehealth platforms for rural healthcare access
- Mental health apps with AI-powered CBT therapy
- Medication adherence apps with smart reminders
- Virtual physical therapy with motion tracking

### Clinical Solutions
- Remote patient monitoring for chronic disease management
- Medical imaging AI assistants for radiologists
- EHR integration platforms
- Clinical decision support systems

## Running the Workflow

### Prerequisites
- Azure OpenAI access configured in `.env` file
- Azure CLI authentication: `az login`

### Launch DevUI
```bash
python healthcare_product_launch_devui.py
```

Access at: **http://localhost:8094**

## Output

- **Console:** Real-time concurrent processing status
- **DevUI:** Interactive visualization with live agent responses
- **File:** Saved to `workflow_outputs/healthcare_analysis_<timestamp>.txt`

## Key Features

✅ Concurrent processing - all 5 agents analyze simultaneously  
✅ Healthcare domain-specific expertise (clinical, regulatory, economic)  
✅ Comprehensive risk and compliance analysis  
✅ Patient-centered design evaluation  
✅ Security and privacy assessment (HIPAA, PHI)  
✅ Aggregated output with clear agent attribution  
✅ Automatic file saving for reference  

## Framework Compatibility

Updated for **Microsoft Agent Framework (new structure)**:
- Custom `Executor` classes for dispatcher and aggregator
- Proper type annotations with `WorkflowContext` and `AgentExecutorResponse`
- `WorkflowBuilder` with fan-out/fan-in edge patterns
- Compatible with DevUI tracing and visualization

## Example Input

```
AI-powered diagnostic tool for early detection of diabetic retinopathy 
using smartphone cameras
```

## Differences from Sequential Workflows

| Aspect | Healthcare (Concurrent) | AgTech (Sequential) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Processing** | All agents run in parallel | Agents run one after another |
| **Agent Context** | Each sees only user input | Each sees full conversation |
| **Speed** | Faster (parallel execution) | Slower (sequential chain) |
| **Dependencies** | No inter-agent dependencies | Each builds on previous |
| **Use Case** | Independent expert opinions | Cumulative analysis pipeline |
| **Best For** | Multi-disciplinary product evaluation | Step-by-step workflow processes |

## Healthcare-Specific Considerations

### Regulatory Complexity
- FDA device classifications (Class I, II, III)
- Clinical evidence requirements vary by risk level
- Post-market surveillance and adverse event reporting

### Reimbursement Challenges
- CPT/HCPCS code establishment can take 2-3 years
- Payer coverage policies differ by geography and plan
- Value-based care models require outcomes data

### Patient Safety & Ethics
- Health equity considerations for diverse populations
- Informed consent and health literacy requirements
- Cultural competency and accessibility standards

### Data Privacy & Security
- HIPAA applies to covered entities and business associates
- PHI has stricter protections than general PII
- Breach notification requirements at federal and state levels

## Tracing Options

Set environment variables to enable tracing:

- **Console:** `ENABLE_CONSOLE_TRACING=true`
- **Application Insights:** `ENABLE_AZURE_AI_TRACING=true`
- **OTLP Endpoint:** `OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317`
- **DevUI Tracing:** `ENABLE_DEVUI_TRACING=true`

## Related Workflows

- **Smart City Infrastructure:** 7-agent urban planning workflow
- **AgTech Food Innovation:** Sequential agricultural innovation workflow
- **Concurrent Agents:** Generic 5-agent product analysis workflow

## Port Configuration

Default port: **8094**

To change the port, modify the `port` parameter in the `serve()` call:
```python
serve(entities=[workflow], port=8095, auto_open=True)
```
