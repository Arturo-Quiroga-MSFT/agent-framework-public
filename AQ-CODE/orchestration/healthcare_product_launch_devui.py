"""
Healthcare Product Launch Workflow - DevUI Version with Tracing

This workflow creates a specialized team of 5 healthcare domain experts to analyze
medical devices, health apps, telehealth services, or other healthcare products.

The workflow uses a fan-out/fan-in pattern where:
- User describes a healthcare product or service
- Input is dispatched to all 5 specialized agents concurrently
- Each agent provides domain-specific analysis
- Results are aggregated and formatted with clear sections

HEALTHCARE AGENTS:
- Clinical Researcher: Evidence-based medicine, clinical trials, efficacy
- Healthcare Compliance: HIPAA, FDA, medical regulations, patient privacy
- Healthcare Economics: Reimbursement, insurance coverage, healthcare ROI
- Patient Experience: User journey, accessibility, patient safety, usability
- Medical Data Security: PHI protection, cybersecurity, data governance

PREREQUISITES:
- Azure OpenAI access configured via .env file in workflows directory
- Azure CLI authentication: Run 'az login'

TRACING OPTIONS:
1. Console Tracing: Set ENABLE_CONSOLE_TRACING=true (simplest)
2. Azure AI Tracing: Set ENABLE_AZURE_AI_TRACING=true (requires Application Insights)
3. OTLP Tracing: Set OTLP_ENDPOINT (e.g., http://localhost:4317 for Jaeger/Zipkin)
4. DevUI Tracing: Set ENABLE_DEVUI_TRACING=true (view in DevUI interface)
