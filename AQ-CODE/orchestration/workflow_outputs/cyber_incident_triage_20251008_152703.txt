🌐 NETWORK FORENSICS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You’re facing a likely security incident: **cryptojacking** has compromised your Kubernetes cluster. Here are recommended steps to respond and remediate:

---

## **Immediate Response**

1. **Containment**
   - **Isolate affected nodes**: Taint or cordon the suspect worker nodes (`kubectl cordon <node>`), or remove them from your load balancer/pool.
   - **Block suspicious containers**: Use `kubectl delete pod` to evict known coin-mining containers immediately.
   - **Restrict image pulls**: Disable external image repository access unless necessary; block via network policies or firewall.

2. **Investigation**
   - **Identify suspicious images:** 
     - `kubectl get pods -A -o wide`
     - Examine images/pod names, look for unfamiliar repositories.
     - `kubectl describe pod <pod>`
   - **Review audit logs**: Check Cloud Provider, Kubernetes API audit logs for unusual actions or privilege escalation.
   - **Check resource usage:** 
     - `kubectl top nodes` / `kubectl top pods`
     - Identify which pods/nodes are consuming excessive CPU.
   - **Examine containers:** Use `kubectl exec` and inspect filesystem/processes.

3. **Eradication**
   - **Remove malicious images**: From internal registry if present.
   - **Delete compromised pods/deployments**: Remove all pods using suspicious images.
   - **Rebuild nodes**: Consider reimaging/rebuilding compromised worker nodes.
   - **Rotate secrets and credentials**: If pod has access to secrets, rotate affected credentials (Kubernetes Secrets, cloud IAM, etc).
   - **Patch Kubernetes and host OS**: Apply latest updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

---

## **Root Cause Analysis**

- **How did attackers get in?**
  - Exposed API server? Misconfigured RBAC? Insecure image pulls? Known vulnerability? Weak service accounts?
- **Review image sources:**
  - Are you pulling from trusted registries?
- **Network policies and RBAC:**
  - Are your clusters locked down by RBAC & NetworkPolicy?

---

## **Prevention**

1. **Image Controls**
   - Use admission controllers (PodSecurityPolicy, OPA/Gatekeeper) to restrict image sources.
   - Only allow trusted registries.

2. **RBAC Hardening**
   - Minimize permissions for service accounts.
   - Review clusterrolebindings.

3. **Node Security**
   - Apply security patches regularly.
   - Use container runtime security features (seccomp, AppArmor).

4. **Runtime Protection**
   - Monitor node/pod CPU, network, and pod creation with tools (Prometheus, Falco, Datadog).
   - Use alerts for abnormal resource usage.

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Enable and review audit logs regularly.

---

## **Reference Commands**

- **List all running pods (show images):**

  ```
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.namespace}:{.metadata.name} -> {.spec.containers[*].image}{'\n'}{end}"
  ```

- **Check images in use:**

  ```
  kubectl describe pod <pod>
  ```

- **Delete a suspicious pod:**

  ```
  kubectl delete pod <pod> -n <namespace>
  ```

- **Cordon a node:**

  ```
  kubectl cordon <node>
  ```

---

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
💻 ENDPOINT ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're describing symptoms strongly indicative of a **compromised Kubernetes cluster**, where threat actors have deployed **malicious containers** for unauthorized crypto-mining. Let me break down the concerns, next steps for investigation, and recommendations:

---

### Key Indicators & Observations

- **Unmanaged crypto-mining processes:** Discovery of mining processes not associated with legitimate workloads.
- **High CPU usage:** Typical in mining compromises, as miners try to maximize resource extraction.
- **Suspicious images pulled:** Attackers often use public, seemingly benign images as a base, or their own images, to evade detection.

---

## Immediate Response

**1. Isolate Affected Nodes:**
   - Cordoning and draining compromised nodes can contain spread.
   - Consider restricting external image pulls until remediation.

**2. Investigate Processes and Containers:**
   - **List running containers & images:**
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods -A -o wide
     docker ps      # On nodes, or containerd/crictl equivalent
     ```
   - **Check suspicious containers:**
     Look for atypical image sources, containers running as root, or those not defined in your manifests.

   - **Inspect process tree:** Mining processes (e.g., `xmrig`, `minerd`, etc.) running inside containers or bare on nodes.

**3. Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Attackers may establish CronJobs, DaemonSets, or modify existing deployment specs, so review:
     ```bash
     kubectl get daemonsets -A
     kubectl get cronjobs -A
     kubectl get deployments -A
     ```

---

## Forensic Steps

- **Identify malicious images:** Note image repositories, tags, digests.
- **Check for credential/secret theft:** Examine logs and kube-api server audit logs for signs of privilege escalation.
- **Review network traffic:** Miners often communicate with external mining pools (e.g., via port 3333, 4444, etc.).

---

## Remediation Steps

**1. Remove Malicious Resources:**
   - Kill rogue containers, delete suspicious pods, remove unknown deployments/daemonsets.

**2. **Patch vulnerabilities:** 
   - Was this a result of exposed API server, unauthenticated kubelet ports, or privilege issues?
   - Check your RBAC policies and network controls.

**3. Rotate Credentials:** 
   - Rotate and re-issue any secrets, service account tokens, and ensure no external exposure.

**4. Audit Cluster Configuration:**
   - Harden endpoints, upgrade software and container runtimes.

---

## Prevention and Detection

- **Enable admission controllers:** Block unknown images and enforce security policies (e.g., PodSecurityPolicies, OPA/Gatekeeper).
- **Monitor nodes and pods:** Use Kubernetes audit logs, runtime security tools (Falco, Sysdig), and EDR solutions.
- **Restrict image pulls:** Use private, trusted registries.
- **Network segmentation:** Block egress to known mining pools.

---

## Final Notes

**This scenario merits urgent action:**  
Crypto-mining is often only the start — attackers may escalate privileges, persist, or exfiltrate further.  
If you're not sure of full compromise scope, a clean node rebuild and thorough cluster audit is advisable.

🧬 MALWARE BEHAVIOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You've described signs of a possible security incident affecting your Kubernetes cluster:

- **Unmanaged crypto-mining processes** observed on worker nodes  
- **Elevated CPU usage**  
- **Suspicious container images** being pulled  

This combination strongly suggests that your cluster may be compromised, with attackers running illicit cryptocurrency miners via unauthorized containers.

**Immediate Incident Response Steps:**

1. **Containment:**
   - **Isolate affected nodes.** Taint/drain them (`kubectl drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets`) or remove them from service.
   - **Stop malicious containers.** Identify and delete suspicious pods and deployments using `kubectl get pods`/`kubectl delete pod` and `kubectl get deployments`.

2. **Investigation:**
   - **Identify container images.** Use `kubectl get pods -A -o wide` and inspect image sources for unfamiliar or public images.
   - **Review audit logs.** Check Kubernetes audit logs and cloud provider logs for evidence of unauthorized access (e.g., `kubectl logs`, `/var/log/kube-apiserver.log`).
   - **Check node processes.** SSH into affected nodes and use tools like `ps aux`, `top`, or `htop` to identify crypto-miner binaries.
   - **Scan for vulnerabilities.** Use tools like `kube-hunter`, `kube-bench`, or `Trivy` to check cluster and container images.

3. **Eradication:**
   - **Remove unauthorized containers and images.** Delete any unknown deployments, DaemonSets, CronJobs, or containers.
   - **Check for persistence mechanisms.** Look for unexpected Kubernetes RBAC roles, ServiceAccounts, secrets, or DaemonSets.
   - **Delete compromised node pools.** In severe cases, consider terminating/replacing affected nodes.

4. **Recovery:**
   - **Patch vulnerabilities.** Update Kubernetes, container runtimes, and base images.
   - **Reset credentials.** Change all cluster access credentials (API tokens, kubeconfigs), and rotate secrets.
   - **Review RBAC policies.** Minimize permissions—principle of least privilege.
   - **Rebuild cluster.** If root cause isn't clear, consider rebuilding from known-good manifests after forensic backup.

5. **Post-Incident:**
   - **Audit what happened.** Document findings, notify stakeholders, and update your threat models.
   - **Enhance monitoring.** Add container runtime monitoring (e.g., Falco, GuardDuty for EKS), image scanning, and anomaly detection.
   - **Restrict image registries.** Only allow approved sources via admission controllers.
   - **Implement Network Policies.** Limit pod-to-pod/node communications.

---

**Key Commands for Investigation:**

```bash
# List pods in all namespaces with images:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath="{..image}" | tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' | sort | uniq -c

# View resource usage:
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces

# Check running processes on node (SSH required):
ps aux | grep -E 'xmrig|miner|cryptominers|cpu_usage'

# Inspect Kubernetes audit logs:
cat /var/log/kubernetes/audit.log | grep -i 'create\|exec'
```

---

**If You Need Help With Forensics:**
- Do not delete evidence before backing up logs and artifacts.
- Engage your security incident response team (SOC/IR).
- Consider contacting Google/AWS/Azure support if using managed services.

---

**Summary:**  
Your cluster shows strong signals of a breach (crypto-mining containers, suspect images, high CPU). Act fast: contain, investigate, eradicate, and harden your environment.

If you'd like help with any of these steps, share more specifics (e.g., node OS, image registry logs, cluster setup), and I can provide targeted guidance or command examples.

📋 RISK & COMPLIANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**You’re facing an incident involving potential unauthorized cryptomining activity in your Kubernetes cluster. Here’s what you should do in response:**

---

## **Immediate Steps: Incident Response**

1. **Isolate Affected Nodes**
   - **Drain** and **cordon** compromised worker nodes (`kubectl drain NODE_NAME --ignore-daemonsets`, `kubectl cordon NODE_NAME`).
   - Remove them from load balancers/clusters if possible.

2. **Preserve Evidence**
   - Do not delete suspicious pods/containers/images yet; obtain forensic snapshots:
     - `kubectl describe pod POD_NAME`
     - `kubectl logs POD_NAME`
     - Get container/image hashes (`docker inspect`, `kubectl get pods -o yaml`)

3. **Identify Malicious Containers & Processes**
   - List running containers: `docker ps` or `crictl ps`
   - Look for images not approved by your organization.
   - Identify containers generating abnormal CPU: `kubectl top pods --all-namespaces`
   - Discover anomalous processes inside containers: `kubectl exec -it POD_NAME -- ps aux`

4. **Review Cluster Events & Audit Logs**
   - Check events: `kubectl get events --all-namespaces` and your cloud provider’s Kubernetes audit logs.

---

## **Investigation**

1. **How Did They Get In?**
   - Look for signs of open Kubernetes API, misconfigured RBAC, exposed dashboard, leaked secrets or credentials.
   - Check for recently created service accounts, role bindings, clusterrolebindings (`kubectl get serviceaccounts --all-namespaces`, etc.)

2. **Verify Image Sources**
   - For suspicious images, check registry logs: Who pulled these, when, from where?
   - Consider scanning images (Trivy, Clair) for malware/miners.

3. **Check For Persistence**
   - Inspect deployments, daemonsets, cronjobs, init containers for persistence mechanisms.
   - Look for unknown third-party tools, scripts, or scheduled jobs.

---

## **Remediation**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🚑 CONTAINMENT & REMEDIATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

It looks like your Kubernetes environment might be compromised. Here’s how to approach this situation:

---

## **Immediate Actions**

1. **Isolate Affected Nodes Immediately:**
   - **Cordoning and Draining**:  
     ```bash
     kubectl cordon <node>
     kubectl drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data
     ```
   - Consider removing compromised nodes from your cluster entirely.

2. **Identify Suspicious Containers and Images:**
   - List running pods:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods -A -o wide
     ```
   - Look for unfamiliar namespaces, pod names, and container images.
   - Investigate images:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
     # Note the container image and commands
     ```

3. **Check for Unauthorized Processes:**
   - SSH into nodes with elevated usage.
   - Run `ps aux` or `top` to spot suspicious high-CPU processes (often named like `kworker`, but could be disguised).

4. **Terminate Malicious Pods & Containers:**
   - Delete suspect pods:
     ```bash
     kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
     ```
   - Remove suspect images and containers at the host level if needed (using `docker` or `containerd` commands).

5. **Block Network Egress If Possible:**
   - Disallow outbound connections from affected pods/nodes; use NetworkPolicies if available.

---

## **Investigation**

1. **Audit Cluster Activity:**
   - Review Kubernetes audit logs.
   - Check for unexpected `kubectl`/API actions and container image pulls.

2. **Analyze Pulled Images:**
   - Inspect unknown images:
     ```bash
     docker image inspect <image>
     ```
   - Search image hashes on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or [Container Registry Security Scanners](https://www.trivy.dev/).

3. **Check for Exploited Vulnerabilities:**
   - Look for exposed K8s dashboards, misconfigured RBAC, public kubelets, weak secrets, or default tokens.

---

## **Remediation & Prevention**

- **Rotate Credentials:**  
  Immediately rotate Kubernetes secrets, tokens, and node credentials.

- **Patch & Harden:**  
  Update cluster components and underlying OS. Limit node permissions.

- **Restrict Image Pulls:**  
  Implement PodSecurityPolicies (or alternatives) and Admission Controllers to restrict who can pull/run which images.

- **Enable Resource Limits:**  
  Set CPU/memory limits to minimize risk from runaway pods.

- **Implement Monitoring:**  
  Use tools like Falco, Kube Audit, or Prometheus to detect abnormal behavior early.

- **Conduct a Full Postmortem:**  
  Document the attack vector, timeline, affected assets, and lessons learned.

- **Contact Cloud Provider or Cybersecurity Team:**  
  If running on managed Kubernetes (GKE, EKS, AKS), contact vendor support.
