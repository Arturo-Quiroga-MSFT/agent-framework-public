## 🔍 THREAT INTELLIGENCE


**Indicators Observed:**  
- Unmanaged crypto-mining processes on Kubernetes worker nodes  
- Elevated CPU usage on affected nodes  
- Pulling of suspicious container images

**Likely TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK):**
- T1612: "Kubernetes Cluster" (Runtime compromising of Kubernetes infrastructure)
- T1203: "Exploitation of Client Execution" (Abuse by executing mining scripts within containers)
- T1569.002: "System Services: Launchctl / Docker" (Abuse of container runtime to execute malicious images)
- T1518.001: "Software Discovery: Container and Orchestration Services" (Enumeration of container infrastructure)
- T1070.004: "Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion" (Often used to clean up crypto-mining logs/artifacts)

**Possible Attribution (confidence):**  
- Likely linked to financially motivated threat actors deploying crypto-jacking campaigns targeting misconfigured Kubernetes clusters (e.g., TeamTNT, Kinsing).  
- Moderate confidence due to alignment between TTPs and known campaigns, but lacking specifics on container image provenance or associated C2 infrastructure.

**Intelligence Gaps:**  
- No observed network IOC (e.g., mining pool domains, wallet addresses, C2 infrastructure)  
- No details on initial access technique (e.g., exposed Kubernetes API, weak credentials, vulnerable image)  
- Insufficient forensic data on container image origins and payload  
- Unclear persistence mechanisms (if any) employed beyond crypto-mining containers  
- No visibility on lateral movement or post-exploitation activities


## 🌐 NETWORK FORENSICS


**Suspicious Flows:**
- High-volume outbound connections from multiple Kubernetes worker node IPs to known crypto-mining pool domains (e.g., miningpool.com:3333), often via TCP port 3333, 5555, or 7777.
- Frequent external connections from pod IPs to unfamiliar IP addresses, especially non-standard cloud regions or anonymizing services.
- Large inbound traffic for docker image pulls from public repositories not on the organization's allowed list, possibly hosted on dynamic domains or personal registries.
- Lateral intra-cluster traffic between compromised worker nodes, especially accessing previously unused ports/services (e.g., sharing mining config or binaries).

**Protocol Anomalies:**
- Unusual outbound protocol mix: sustained use of Stratum protocol (typically for crypto-mining) over TCP, often with encrypted payloads.
- Docker/ContainerD API calls from unexpected sources, possibly over HTTP (non-TLS) or with anomalous headers/user-agents.
- Unscheduled requests to the Kubernetes API server from worker node containers, suggesting privilege escalation or manipulation of cluster resources.
- Evidence of auto-scaled pods or containers with unexpected container images lacking proper provenance.

**Lateral Movement Hypotheses:**
- Attackers leverage compromised container images with embedded mining binaries or scripts to propagate across worker nodes.
- Exploitation of overly broad Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or unsecured Kubelet API, allowing attackers to spawn new pods or replace images on peer nodes.
- SSH/remote access attempts between worker nodes using credentials extracted from container environment variables or mounted secrets.
- Potential use of intra-cluster service accounts with elevated privileges to programmatically interact with the Kubernetes API and orchestrate further compromise.

**Recommended Network Containment:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**  
   - Quarantine affected worker nodes by removing them from the cluster and isolating their network interfaces.
   - Block all outbound connections to known mining pool IP ranges/domains at the perimeter firewall.
   - Terminate all suspicious container images and revoke pulls from unapproved registries.

2. **Short-term Remediation:**  
   - Revoke and rotate credentials/secrets exposed to the compromised environments.
   - Review and tighten network segmentation policies (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies) to restrict pod-to-pod communications, especially across namespaces.
   - Disable auto-scaling or image pulling from untrusted sources until cluster integrity is verified.

3. **Long-term Safeguards:**  
   - Enforce container image signing and provenance checks for all deployments.
   - Limit RBAC privileges and require approval for privileged operations (e.g., image pulls, node joins).
   - Implement cluster-wide network flow monitoring and anomaly detection (e.g., IDS for Kubernetes network).
   - Conduct a full forensic review of node filesystems, container logs, and Kubernetes audit logs to trace initial infection and exfil paths.

**Summary:**  
Unmanaged crypto-mining on Kubernetes worker nodes is often accompanied by suspicious flows to mining pools, exploitation of weak segmentation/RBAC, and lateral movement via compromised container images. Immediate isolation, network blocking, and privilege review are essential to contain further spread and eradicate infection.


## 💻 ENDPOINT ANALYSIS


Key Host Artifacts:

- Suspicious processes on worker nodes (e.g., xmrig, minerd, cpuminer, etc.):
  - Unusual process names or renamed crypto-miners.
  - High, sustained CPU utilization by unfamiliar processes.
  - Processes running outside of expected container runtimes (i.e., directly on the host).
- Container images pulled from untrusted registries or with non-standard tags.
- Container runtime process trees where mining binaries are executing.

Persistence Mechanisms:

- Unauthorized containers configured with privileged mode or host access.
- Modified Kubernetes pod specs or YAML files pulling malicious images.
- Cronjobs created to respawn mining containers or processes.
- Possible tampering with container init/start scripts.
- Host-level persistence via altered user data, scheduled tasks (e.g., crontab), or systemd service units.

Privilege Escalation Attempts:

- Containers running with root privileges (securityContext > privileged: true).
- Attempts to escape containers (e.g., mounting host filesystems, touching /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow).
- Dropper binaries attempting to modify sudoers or escalate local privileges.
- Evidence of kernel exploits (e.g., loading unusual kernel modules from container or host).

Host Triage Recommendations:

1. **Process Review**: Enumerate running processes for mining binaries; kill unauthorized processes. Review CPU utilization per process.
2. **Container Inspection**: List recent container images/instances; verify source and content; remove any untrusted or evidence of compromise.
3. **Persistence Check**: Review crontab entries, systemd units, Kubernetes jobs/DaemonSets for mining re-spawn logic.
4. **Root Escalation Audit**: Query for containers running privileged or as root. Check for host file modifications.
5. **Registry/Service Analysis**: Analyze unusual registry/service configurations if running on Windows nodes.
6. **Log Analysis**: Check kubelet, container runtime, and auth logs for evidence of compromise and lateral movement.
7. **Image Hygiene**: Block non-trusted registries and enforce image signing.
8. **Node Recovery**: Consider re-imaging compromised nodes after evidence preservation.
9. **IOCs Collection**: Collect process and file hashes, container image IDs, and community mining wallets for threat intelligence sharing.

**Immediate recommendation:** Isolate affected nodes for forensic collection, patch cluster escape vulnerabilities, audit RBAC policies and image sources, and remove any artifacts of mining activity.


## 🧬 MALWARE BEHAVIOR


Behavior Hypotheses

- Unmanaged crypto-mining processes indicate deployment of cryptojacking malware, which leverages worker node resources for cryptocurrency mining.
- Suspicious container images suggest adversaries used public or compromised registries to deploy malicious containers.
- Elevated CPU usage likely stems from mining operations (e.g., xmrig, cgminer, etc.) running intensively.
- Attackers may have exploited weak or misconfigured Kubernetes permissions (e.g., permissive RBAC, exposed APIs).
- Persistence might be ensured by additional containers/sidecars or cron jobs created via Kubernetes manifests.

Encryption/Exfil Traits

- Mining processes generally transmit shares/blocks to mining pools or proxy servers, using encrypted (TLS) or obfuscated TCP traffic on nonstandard ports.
- Wallet addresses and pool configurations may be embedded in environment variables or config files inside compromised containers.
- Outbound connections to known mining pool domains or IPs.

Evasion Techniques

- Containers may be labeled/renamed to appear benign or mimic legitimate services.
- Mining software might throttle usage, evade basic resource-based anomaly detection.
- Malicious container images could have altered histories – shallow/faked layers, misleading Dockerfile instructions.
- Use of rootless containers or sub-process injection to avoid visibility in standard process trees.
- Mining payloads delivered via remote exec (kubectl exec), avoiding modification of image manifests.
- Potential disabling of logging or security agents within affected pods/nodes.

Needed Forensic Artifacts

- Kubernetes audit logs, especially create/pull/exec events for suspicious containers.
- Container image metadata: creation times, origins, hashes.
- Runtime process snapshots (ps aux, top) showing unauthorized mining executables.
- Network logs (node- and pod-level) detailing outbound connections, especially to mining pools.
- Container file system dumps: wallet addresses, config files, executables.
- Pod and deployment manifests for evidence of unauthorized resource allocation or schedules.
- Node syslogs and Kubernetes event streams for anomalies in resource consumption, error/event spikes.
- Cluster role bindings, service account usage (to track privilege escalation or abuse).
- Memory and disk artifacts for traces of process injection or ephemeral payloads.


## 📋 RISK & COMPLIANCE


Regulatory Considerations:
- Potential breach of security controls under laws such as GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), NDB (Australia), or other data protection regimes if personal data or sensitive data is processed on impacted nodes.
- Security incident reporting obligations under national/international laws and industry standards (e.g., NIS2 Directive in EU, NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation in New York, PCI DSS if payment card data is processed).
- Possible violation of contractual or cloud provider security requirements.

Reporting Deadlines:
- GDPR: Supervisory Authority notification within 72 hours if personal data breach is confirmed.
- CCPA: Notification "in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay" if PII of California residents is involved.
- NDB (Australia): Notification to OAIC and affected individuals “as soon as practicable” if eligible data breach.
- PCI DSS: Immediate notification to card brands/acquirers if cardholder data compromised.
- Other jurisdictions may have specific timelines; confirm based on affected data subjects’ locations.

Data Categories Affected:
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) if any is stored or processed on the compromised nodes (user records, credentials, transaction logs).
- Sensitive system configuration data and cloud resource credentials.
- Operational telemetry and possibly intellectual property.
- If suspicious container images access network volumes or credentials, consider risk to external systems/data.

Compliance Risks:
- Failure to detect and respond to unauthorized resource use (potential violation of minimum security standards).
- Inadequate segmentation or protection of data leading to risk of unauthorized disclosure or processing.
- Incomplete asset management and container image provenance tracking.
- Risk of regulatory penalties, litigation, or reputational damage if breach is confirmed and not reported as required.
- Potential lack of audit trails or inadequate monitoring/logging which could impede forensic investigations and compliance reporting.

Recommendation: Assess whether personal or regulated data was present/accessible on compromised nodes; conduct forensic review; consult legal counsel to determine breach status and notification obligations as per applicable jurisdiction(s). Implement containment, review container image sourcing, and strengthen workload protection.


## 🚑 CONTAINMENT & REMEDIATION


0-6h Actions
- Isolate affected Kubernetes worker nodes from the cluster and network to prevent lateral movement and further resource drain.
- Block outbound connections from affected nodes to prevent data exfiltration and command-and-control communications.
- Identify and stop suspicious containers; kill any container processes linked to known crypto-mining behavior.
- Revoke credentials/tokens used by compromised nodes to prevent further access.
- Capture forensic snapshots of affected nodes and containers for future investigation.
- Review Kubernetes audit logs and cloud provider logs for indicators of compromise and initial access vectors.

6-24h Actions
- Remove malicious container images from local registries and blocklists; update image scanning policies to prevent future pulls.
- Scan all remaining cluster nodes (and adjacent infrastructure) for crypto-mining artifacts and unauthorized processes.
- Patch/upgrade Kubernetes worker nodes to the latest stable version.
- Rotate secrets and credentials across the cluster (API tokens, service account tokens, etc).
- Review and enhance network segmentation and RBAC policies to limit container communication and privilege escalation.

1-7d Actions
- Conduct root cause analysis to understand the attack vector (e.g., vulnerable images, exposed API, supply chain compromise).
- Implement continuous image scanning and enforce signed image policies in CI/CD pipelines.
- Schedule ongoing vulnerability scanning of cluster nodes and containers.
- Establish automated alerting for abnormal resource usage (CPU, memory, outbound bandwidth).
- Review and, if necessary, redeploy worker nodes with fresh images to ensure removal of persistent compromise.

Longer-Term Hardening
- Enforce strict image provenance: allow only signed and trusted container images from private registries.
- Enable pod security policies or PodSecurity admission controls to prevent privilege escalation.
- Implement network policies to strictly limit pod-to-pod and pod-to-external connections.
- Integrate runtime security tools (e.g., Falco, Aqua, Sysdig) for real-time threat detection.
- Regularly train engineering teams on secure Kubernetes and container operational practices.

Risk Reduction Rationale
- Immediate containment (0-6h) blocks further resource hijacking, data exfiltration, and lateral movement, minimizing cost and damage.
- Next-phase actions (6-24h) ensure eradication of the threat, address privilege misuse, and repair security gaps.
- Short-term and long-term improvements build in systemic resilience against container/image-based attacks, supply chain compromise, and unauthorized resource consumption, reducing recurrence risk and ensuring incident response readiness.
