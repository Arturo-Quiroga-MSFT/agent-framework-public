- **Purpose limitation:** Ensure surveillance capabilities (e.g., cameras, analytics) are not repurposed for unintended secondary uses without public consultation and legal review.

**Facial Recognition Policies:**  
- If camera feeds are integrated (for traffic or pedestrian analysis), strictly regulate use of facial recognition:
    - Require public consultation.
    - Mandate explicit consent where feasible.
    - Prohibit use for law enforcement unless legal, proportional, and necessary.
    - Deploy independent oversight and algorithmic bias reviews.

### Data Retention, Deletion, and Compliance

**Retention & Deletion:**  
- **Define retention schedules:** Air quality data can be retained longer for longitudinal studies; traffic video feeds or PII-linked data must be time-bound (days to weeks).
- **Automate deletion:** Use secure deletion mechanisms and audit trails.

**GDPR/CCPA Compliance:**  
- Inform data subjects (citizens) about data use, enable access/correction/deletion rights where applicable.
- Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs).

### Security Architecture

**Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure:**  
- **Segmentation:** Isolate sensor networks from core city systems and public networks.
- **Zero Trust principles:** Verify all devices, users, and applications seeking access.
- **Continuous monitoring:** Deploy SIEM (Security Information & Event Management) for real-time anomaly detection across OT and IT layers.

**OT/IT Convergence Security:**  
- **Unified security policies:** Address both physical (OT: traffic lights controllers) and digital (IT: data repositories).
- **Secure gateways:** Use firewalls and secure bridges between IoT devices, OT networks, and central monitoring platforms.

**IoT Device Security:**  
- **Hardening:** Disable default credentials, close unnecessary ports, patch vulnerabilities.
- **Physical tampering protections:** Deploy intrusion detection, tamper-evident hardware.

**Encryption (data at rest and in transit):**  
- **TLS for data in transit:** Between sensors, gateways, and aggregation platforms.
- **AES-256 for data at rest:** In city data repositories and cloud storage.

**Access Controls:**  
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Operators have only the necessary permissions. Limit privileged access.
- **Multi-factor authentication:** For administrators and support staff.

**Incident Response:**  
- **Prepared plans for breaches:** Including notification, containment, forensic investigation, and public communication.
- **Regular testing:** Tabletop exercises for incident scenarios involving sensor manipulation or unauthorized data access.

### Public Trust & Responsible Innovation

**Transparency & Engagement:**  
- **Open data initiatives:** Share non-sensitive air quality data with the public for research and community initiatives.
- **Privacy impact disclosures:** Summarize ongoing privacy practices, audit results, and policy updates.

**Balance Innovation/Privacy:**  
- **Regular review:** Convene multi-stakeholder panels (technologists, ethicists, civil society) to assess societal impact and adjust practices.
- **Redress mechanisms:** Citizens can report concerns or abuses, triggering investigations.
