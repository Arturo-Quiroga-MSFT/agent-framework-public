- Adherence to financial recordkeeping and anti-money laundering (AML) standards if handling or facilitating financial transactions.
- May need to comply with Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) if processing payments.
- Requirements from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regarding transparency and user protections.

**Required Disclaimers:**
- "Not financial advice": Clearly state that app outputs do not constitute professional financial, investment, or tax advice.
- Disclosure of risks associated with reliance on AI-generated recommendations.
- Accuracy disclaimer: Inform users that results may be based on incomplete or outdated data.
- If applicable, explicit disclaimers regarding third-party integrations and their reliability.
- If sharing user data with third parties, must disclose such practices in privacy policy.

**Potential Liability Concerns:**

- Data breaches or unauthorized access to personal financial information.
- Allegations of discrimination or bias in AI-driven financial decisions impacting protected groups.
- Risk of unintentional facilitation of fraud if adequate user identity verification mechanisms are absent.

**Intellectual Property Considerations:**
- Own or have licenses to use all source code, AI models, datasets, and third-party integrations.

**Summary:**

Regular compliance reviews and transparent user communications are essential.
