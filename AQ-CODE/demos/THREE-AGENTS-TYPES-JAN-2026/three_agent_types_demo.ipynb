    "# Three Agent Types Demo - Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Updated: January 2026 - Using Latest MAF Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **three types of agents** available in Microsoft Agent Framework and their different chat history management approaches. **This notebook uses the latest API patterns from MAF** (see `/maf-upstream/python/samples/` for official examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Azure AI Agent** (`AzureAIProjectAgentProvider`) - Service-managed threads stored server-side\n",
    "2. **Azure OpenAI Chat Completion** (`AzureOpenAIChatClient`) - Client-managed history with full control\n",
    "3. **Azure OpenAI Responses** (`AzureOpenAIResponsesClient`) - Flexible history (both service and custom)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each demo shows:\n",
    "- How to create and configure each agent type **using latest MAF patterns**\n",
    "- Environment variables required for each\n",
    "- Multi-turn conversations demonstrating memory/context handling\n",
    "- When to use each agent type based on your requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key API Changes (Latest MAF)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Azure AI**: Now uses `AzureAIProjectAgentProvider` (not `AzureAIClient`)  \n",
    "✅ **Azure OpenAI**: Now uses `.as_agent()` method (not `.create_agent()`)  \n",
    "✅ **Thread Management**: Now uses `agent.get_new_thread()` (preferred over `AgentThread()`)  \n",
    "✅ **Storage Control**: New `store=True/False` parameter for message persistence  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.9+ with packages: `agent-framework`, `agent-framework-azure-ai`, `azure-identity`\n",
    "- Azure CLI authentication: Run `az login` before executing cells\n",
    "- Azure AI Foundry project (for Azure AI Agent)\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI resource (for Chat and Responses agents)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Each agent type uses different environment variable names - see setup cell below for details."

    "This demo shows how to use the **Azure AI V2 API** (`azure-ai-projects` 2.x) with explicit thread management:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key V2 API Patterns:**\n",
    "1. **`create_version()`** - Creates immutable agent versions (not ephemeral agents)\n",
    "2. **`provider.as_agent()`** - Wraps SDK objects as ChatAgent without HTTP calls  \n",
    "3. **`agent.get_new_thread()`** - Creates threads for conversation state\n",
    "4. **`agent.run(query, thread=thread)`** - Executes with explicit thread control\n",
    "5. **`delete_version()`** - Removes specific agent versions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of V2 API:**\n",
    "- ✅ Immutable versions prevent accidental changes\n",
    "- ✅ Version history for rollback and comparison\n",
    "- ✅ Production-ready agent management\n",
    "- ✅ Efficient wrapping without extra API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use this pattern:**\n",
    "- Production deployments requiring version control\n",
    "- Multi-environment scenarios (dev/staging/prod)\n",
    "- Audit trails of agent configuration changes\n",
    "- Rollback capabilities for agent updates\n",

    "#### 4. Server vs In-Memory Storage Control\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# NEW: Control where messages are stored\n",
    "result = await agent.run(query, thread=thread, store=False)  # In-memory only\n",
    "result = await agent.run(query, thread=thread, store=True)   # Server-side storage\n",
    "result = await agent.run(query, thread=thread)               # Default behavior\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conversation State Management\n",
    "**Critical Discovery**: Without passing a thread object, each `agent.run()` call is completely independent - the agent has NO memory of previous interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong - Each call is a new conversation\n",
    "result1 = await agent.run(\"My favorite color is blue.\")\n",
    "result2 = await agent.run(\"What's my favorite color?\")  # Agent won't remember!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Correct - Use thread to maintain conversation state\n",
    "thread = agent.get_new_thread()\n",
    "result1 = await agent.run(\"My favorite color is blue.\", thread=thread)\n",
    "result2 = await agent.run(\"What's my favorite color?\", thread=thread)  # Agent remembers!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Variable Naming\n",
    "Each agent type uses **different** deployment variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Agent Type | Deployment Variable Name |\n",
    "|------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| Azure AI Agent | `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` |\n",
    "| Azure OpenAI Chat | `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` |\n",
    "| Azure OpenAI Responses | `AZURE_OPENAI_RESPONSES_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** This allows flexibility to use different models for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure OpenAI Responses API Endpoint Requirements\n",
    "The Responses API has strict endpoint requirements:\n",
    "- ✅ **Works with**: `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/` (Native Azure OpenAI)\n",
    "- ❌ **Does NOT work with**: `https://your-resource.services.ai.azure.com/` (Azure AI Foundry)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** The Responses API is a preview feature only available on native Azure OpenAI Service endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chat History Storage Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "| Agent Type | History Storage | When to Use |\n",
    "|------------|----------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Azure AI Agent** | Service-managed (server-side) or in-memory | Production apps, want Azure to handle persistence |\n",
    "| **Azure OpenAI Chat** | Client-managed (you store it) | Custom storage (DB, Redis), full control |\n",
    "| **Azure OpenAI Responses** | Both options available | Most flexible, can choose per use case |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: All agents use thread objects to maintain conversation state during execution. The `store` parameter controls where messages persist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication Pattern\n",
    "All demos use Azure CLI authentication:\n",
    "1. Run `az login` in terminal\n",
    "2. Use `AzureCliCredential()` in code\n",
    "3. Azure handles authentication automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the recommended approach for development and testing. Production apps should use Managed Identity or Service Principal authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Migration Guide Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Old API | New API |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| Azure AI Agent | `AzureAIClient` | `AzureAIProjectAgentProvider` |\n",
    "| Agent Creation | `.create_agent()` | `await provider.create_agent()` (AI Agent) or `.as_agent()` (OpenAI) |\n",
    "| Thread Creation | `AgentThread()` | `agent.get_new_thread()` (preferred) |\n",
    "| Storage Control | N/A | `store=True/False` parameter |\n",
