    "# Travel Customer Support with Handoff Orchestration designed by Jason\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **handoff orchestration** using the Microsoft Agent Framework. We'll build a travel customer support system where agents can transfer control to specialists based on the customer's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn:\n",
    "1. **Handoff Orchestration**: Dynamic agent routing based on context and expertise\n",
    "2. **HandoffBuilder**: High-level API for building handoff workflows\n",
    "3. **Specialist Routing**: Agents can hand off to other agents dynamically\n",
    "4. **Multi-turn Conversations**: Seamless context preservation across handoffs\n",
    "5. **Customer Support Flow**: Real-world application of agent handoffs"
