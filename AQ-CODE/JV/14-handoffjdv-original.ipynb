    "1. **Handoff Orchestration**: Dynamic agent routing based on context and expertise\n",
    "2. **HandoffBuilder**: High-level API for building handoff workflows\n",
    "3. **Specialist Routing**: Agents can hand off to other agents dynamically\n",
    "4. **Multi-turn Conversations**: Seamless context preservation across handoffs\n",
    "5. **Customer Support Flow**: Real-world application of agent handoffs"
