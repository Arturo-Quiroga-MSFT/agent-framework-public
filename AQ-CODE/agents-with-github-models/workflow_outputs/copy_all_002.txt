I'm sorry to hear about your lost package. Let me help you resolve this:

1. Could you tell me when your order was supposed to arrive? Usually, if it's been over 2 weeks past the expected delivery date, we consider the package lost.
2. Have you checked the tracking information for any updates or messages from the carrier?
3. If there are no updates and it's past the timeframe, I can initiate a refund for you.

Please provide any additional details, or let me know if you'd like me to start the refund process.
