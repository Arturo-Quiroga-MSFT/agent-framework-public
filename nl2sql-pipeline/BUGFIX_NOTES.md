## Issue: "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" Error

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**File:** `db_utils.py`, line 208

### Problem
The `execute_query()` method in `db_utils.py` was returning columns as a list of strings:
```python
columns = ["CustomerName", "TotalRevenue", ...]
```

But the `_format_results()` method in `executors.py` expected columns as a list of dictionaries:
```python
columns = [{"name": "CustomerName"}, {"name": "TotalRevenue"}, ...]
```

This caused the error when trying to call `col.get("name", "")` on a string object.

### Root Cause
Line 208 in `db_utils.py`:
```python
columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.description] if cursor.description else []
```

This extracted just the column names as strings, not as dictionary objects.

### Solution
Modified line 208-209 to create dictionary objects:
```python
column_names = [column[0] for column in cursor.description] if cursor.description else []
columns = [{"name": col_name} for col_name in column_names]
```

Also updated line 217 to use `column_name` instead of `column` for consistency.

### Testing
After this fix:
1. Restart the workflow: `python nl2sql_workflow.py`
2. Submit a test question in DevUI (http://localhost:8097)
3. Verify that results are displayed without the "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" error

### Expected Behavior
Query results should now display properly with:
- Execution time
- Row count
- Column names
- Data rows

Example output:
```
QUERY RESULTS:

Execution Time: 123.45ms
Rows Returned: 10

Columns: CustomerName, TotalRevenue

Data:
  Row 1: CustomerName=Acme Corp, TotalRevenue=125000.00
  Row 2: CustomerName=Widget Inc, TotalRevenue=98500.50
  ...
```
