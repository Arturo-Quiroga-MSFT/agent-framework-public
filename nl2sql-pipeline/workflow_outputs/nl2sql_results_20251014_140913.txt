**Answer:**  
All four customers are small businesses, none are designated VIPs, and only one (Vargas-Snyder) is classified as high risk.

**Insights:**

- Customer Tiers vary, including Gold, Bronze, and Platinum, indicating differing account statuses or value levels.
- Only one company (Vargas-Snyder) is flagged as high risk, and none are marked as VIPs.
- Employee counts and annual revenues vary considerably, with employee counts ranging from 5 to 92 and revenues from approximately $2.37M to $3.9M.
