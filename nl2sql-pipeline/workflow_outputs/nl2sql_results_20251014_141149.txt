**Answer:**  
Among these ten customers, only one (Fleet Transportation Corp) is a VIP, and four customers are classified as high risk. Customers span small business, middle market, and large corporate segments.

**Insights:**
- The only VIP is Fleet Transportation Corp, a large corporate, platinum-tier customer with the highest employee count (475) and revenue ($62M).
- Four customers are marked as high risk: three small businesses and one middle market company.
- Most customers (7 out of 10) are in the small business segment; the others are middle market or large corporate.
- There is broad diversity in company size (from 7 to 804 employees) and revenue (from ~$623K up to $62M).
- The majority of customers are bronze-tier, with only two in platinum and one in silver.

**Suggestions:**
- Are you interested in analyzing the characteristics or risk factors of high-risk customers vs. non-high-risk customers?
- Would you like detailed comparisons between VIP, high-risk, and standard customers across all segments or tiers?
