## Documentation Created:

### 1. **README.md** - Main Entry Point
- Strategic vision and overview
- Architecture diagram
- Component descriptions
- Quick start guide
- Implementation roadmap
- Technical stack
- Success criteria

### 2. **INTEGRATION_OVERVIEW.md** - Strategic Integration
- Executive summary
- Why this integration works
- Integration patterns (3 detailed approaches)
- Component responsibilities
- Cloud-agnostic architecture
- Storage/state/observability abstractions
- Deployment flexibility examples
- Security considerations
- Migration path (8-week roadmap)
- Success metrics

### 3. **ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md** - Detailed Design Patterns
- **Integration Patterns** (MCP Sidecar, Microservices, Embedded)
- **Deployment Patterns** (Container multi-cloud, Serverless, Hybrid)
- **Communication Patterns** (Sync, Async, Event-driven)
- **State Management** (Shared store, Cloud-native backends)
- **Observability** (OpenTelemetry, Unified logging)
- Pattern comparison table with ratings

### 4. **LANGGRAPH_MCP_INTEGRATION.md** - Implementation Guide
- Step-by-step tutorial
- Complete code examples (LangGraph agent → MCP server)
- Containerization (Dockerfile, requirements)
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- MAF orchestrator integration code
- Advanced patterns (multi-tool, streaming, state management)
- Testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e)
- Monitoring with OpenTelemetry
- Production checklist

## Key Highlights:

✅ **Complete end-to-end guidance** from concept to production  
✅ **Cloud-agnostic by design** - same code runs on Azure/AWS/GCP/on-prem  
✅ **Practical code examples** ready to use  
✅ **Multiple deployment patterns** for different use cases  
✅ **Production-ready** with observability, testing, security  
✅ **8-week implementation roadmap** with clear phases  

This gives Teradata everything they need to evaluate and implement LangGraph + MAF for cloud-agnostic AI agent deployment! 🚀
