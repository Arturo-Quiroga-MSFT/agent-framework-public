Meeting notes:
Migration Path from Semantic Kernel to Agent Framework: 
Jason, Arturo, and the team, including Wes, Jayla, Jack, and Eric, discussed the technical and strategic aspects of migrating from Semantic Kernel to Agent Framework, reviewing migration guides, dependencies, and the pros and cons of different approaches, with Arturo providing detailed documentation and ongoing support for the transition.
	Migration Overview and Rationale: Arturo explained that Microsoft is unifying Semantic Kernel and Autogen into Agent Framework, with future development and support focused on Agent Framework. The team discussed the importance of migrating early to avoid technical debt and benefit from new features, with Wes and Eric agreeing that the migration effort is expected to be low and that switching sooner would be advantageous.
	Migration Steps and Checklist: Arturo shared a migration guide outlining a phased approach: preparation, package migration, core service migration, plugin/function migration, image handling, testing, and cleanup. The guide includes specific actions such as reviewing SK usage, setting up test environments, updating dependencies, converting plugins, and benchmarking performance.
	Technical Options: IChatClient vs. AIAgent: Arturo described two main migration options: using IChatClient for control and predictability with minimal framework changes, or adopting AIAgent for agent persona, tool calling, and streaming with less glue code. The team discussed decision shortcuts and practical recommendations based on their current orchestration and plugin usage.
	Dependency and Code Changes: The migration involves removing Semantic Kernel packages and adding Agent Framework and Azure OpenAI packages. Arturo provided code samples for dependency injection, function registration, and image handling, highlighting the need to update namespaces and convert plugin classes to regular C# methods using AIFunctionFactory.
	Ongoing Support and Next Steps: Arturo committed to ongoing technical guidance, including weekly reviews of Agent Framework changes and updating migration documentation. The team agreed to share details about their plugins and functions to receive more prescriptive migration advice, and planned follow-up sessions to review MCP tools and design the multi-agent framework.
Multi-Agent Architecture and Orchestration Strategy: 
Jack demonstrated a prototype of multi-agent workflows using Semantic Kernel, prompting a discussion led by Jason, Wes, and Eric on how to decompose capabilities into agents, orchestrate tool access, and design scalable agent-based systems for future releases.
	Prototype Demonstration: Jack showcased a prototype where multiple personas (data modeler and reviewer) interact in a group chat to build a data model, illustrating the potential for automated agent collaboration and reduced human intervention in the workflow.
	Agent Skills and Context Management: Jason and Wes discussed the need to avoid large context windows by chunking tools into agent-specific subsets, with orchestration layers directing requests to the appropriate agent. Jason referenced best practices from other partners and emphasized defining agent personas, skills, and tool sets to optimize workflow.
	Orchestration Layer Design: David and Wes raised questions about the breakdown between orchestration logic and deterministic code, seeking clarity on where to implement business logic—at the agent or tool level. Jason advised that higher-level logic should reside in agents for flexibility and maintainability, with tools remaining universal across applications.
	Startup Mode and Agile Development: Eric proposed a fast, agile development approach for the upcoming release cycle, suggesting the team operate in 'startup mode' to rapidly prototype, experiment, and iterate on agent-based features before formalizing deliverables. The group agreed to balance rapid progress with business commitments and planned to use prototyping to set direction.
MCP Server Integration and Tooling Strategy: 
Eric, Wes, and Jason discussed the integration of MCP servers for tool management, debating the optimal division of logic between MCP tools and agents, and planning deep-dive sessions to align on architecture and workflow for scalable multi-agent systems.
	Current MCP Server Usage: Wes and Eric clarified that MCP servers are being used to host kernel functions and tools, with the server making API calls rather than direct database access. The team is moving existing tools into MCP servers and expanding their capabilities.
	Tool and Agent Logic Separation: Eric and Jason debated whether complex logic should be embedded in MCP tools or pushed up to agents. Jason recommended keeping tools at a low granularity and implementing higher-level logic in agents to allow for dynamic evolution and reuse across applications.
	Design Session Planning: The team agreed to schedule a session after the holiday break to review MCP tools, define agent workflows, and diagram the multi-agent framework. This will inform the architectural direction and set the stage for rapid prototyping in February.
Release Planning and Team Coordination: 
Eric, Jason, and the team coordinated timelines for migration, prototyping, and release cycles, aligning on resource availability, business commitments, and next steps for agent framework adoption and multi-agent design.
	Timeline and Resource Planning: Eric and Jason discussed team availability, aiming to begin pre-work and design sessions in January, with rapid prototyping scheduled for February and a target for migration readiness by May. Jayla will help coordinate meetings and information sharing.
	Business Commitments and Flexibility: Eric emphasized the need to set expectations with the business, balancing fast progress with the ambiguity of deliverables, and ensuring that no critical customer features depend solely on the new agent framework during the transition.
Follow-up tasks:
