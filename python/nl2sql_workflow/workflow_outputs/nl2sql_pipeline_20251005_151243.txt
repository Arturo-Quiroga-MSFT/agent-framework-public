💬 STAGE 1: USER QUESTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

what woudl be good questiosn to ask to gain insights fromo the DB

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🎯 STAGE 2: INTENT ANALYZER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Primary intent: Identify potential SELECT, aggregate, and analytical queries for data exploration.
- Entities mentioned: General entities within the database (no specific tables). Focus is on uncovering what kinds of data or information are valuable.
- Conditions/filters requested: None directly; question is about suggesting queries, not filtering data yet.
- Required aggregations or calculations: Suggestions could include aggregations (e.g., counts, averages), rankings, trends, or joins, depending on database context.
- Expected output format: List of insightful question examples (natural language), such as:
    - What are the most common (entity) values?
    - How has (metric) changed over time?
    - What are the relationships between (table1) and (table2)?
    - What is the distribution of (field or category)?
    - Are there any anomalies in (column)?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
📊 STAGE 3: SCHEMA EXPERT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Schema Mapping for "what would be good questions to ask to gain insights from the DB":

1. **Relevant tables needed**: Use a variety of tables—dbo.Loan, dbo.Company, dbo.Collateral, dbo.PaymentEvent, dbo.Covenant, snapshots, etc.—since "insights" could span entities (loans, payments, customers, covenants, risk metrics).
2. **Specific columns to query**: Consider key business fields (e.g.: Loan.PrincipalAmount, Company.Industry/CountryCode, PaymentEvent.Amount/DaysDelinquent, Collateral.ValueAmount, Covenant.Status, ESGScore) for aggregates, trends, and relationships.
3. **JOIN relationships required**: Insights often require joins, e.g., Loan to Company, PaymentEvent to Loan, Collateral to Loan, Covenant to Loan, etc.
4. **Indexes that could help performance**: Commonly indexed columns—LoanId (across tables), CompanyId, PaymentEventId, dates (OriginationDate, EventDate, ValuationDate).
5. **Schema limitations**: Some insight questions may require historical tracking or dimensions (e.g., time trends) that are only partially addressed (fact_loan_payments, LoanDelinquencyFeaturesSnapshot); lack of explicit business logic or supplementary metadata may limit the depth of derived insights. 

**Summary**:  
- Consider which tables contain key business data (loans, payments, customers, covenants, collateral, metrics).
- Build questions around aggregates, time series, relationships, and exceptions/anomalies, using joins where necessary.
- Use indexed fields for performance in complex queries.
- Schema allows for a wide range of insight questions but deeper context (e.g., strategic KPIs) may require application/domain knowledge beyond raw schema.

💻 STAGE 4: SQL GENERATOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Certainly! Here are examples of good questions you could ask to gain insights from your SQL Server database. For each, I've included a brief rationale and the kind of SQL queries they may translate to:

1. **What are the largest entities?**
   - Which loans have the highest principal amounts?
   - Which companies have the most loans or the biggest exposures?

2. **What are the most common categories?**
   - What are the main industries or risk types in the portfolio?
   - Which collateral types are most frequently used?

3. **How is performance trending over time?**
   - How do loan delinquency rates change month-over-month?
   - What are the trends in payment delays or defaults?

4. **Where are the geographic concentrations?**
   - Which countries or regions are most represented in customers or loans?
   - Are there concentrations of risk in certain areas?

5. **What is the distribution of values or metrics?**
   - What does the distribution of ESG scores look like?
   - How many loans fall into various risk bands?

6. **Are there any anomalies or outliers?**
   - Which loans have unusually high collateral value relative to principal?
   - Are there payments that are significantly late compared to others?

7. **What are the relationships between entities?**
   - How do payment events relate to loan maturity profiles?
   - Do specific covenants or conditions correspond to better/worse loan outcomes?

8. **What are the top/bottom performers?**
   - Who are the top ten companies by aggregate loan value?
   - Which loans have the best/worst performance metrics?

9. **Are there notable risk exposures?**
   - Which loans are most at risk of default based on recent delinquency snapshots?
   - Are there concentrations of covenant breaches?

10. **How do metrics compare to benchmarks?**
    - Are the average payment delays increasing or decreasing compared to last year?
    - What is the average collateral value vs. loan principal, and how does it compare across industries?

---

**To write these queries, you would need to:**
- Use aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN).
- Use GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses for rankings and distributions.
- Use WHERE clauses to filter for anomalies or explore specific categories.
- JOIN related tables for richer insights across entities.
- Use window functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER(), RANK()) for top-N analytics.
- Consider time-based breakdowns (using EventDate, OriginationDate, etc.).

*These strategic questions help guide what data to extract and analyze, leading to actionable business insights from your database!*

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ STAGE 5: SQL VALIDATOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Here are some good example questions you could ask to gain insights from your database, based solely on the tables and columns themselves:

1. **What are the most active or important entities?**
   - Which tables have the highest row counts?

2. **Trends and aggregations:**
   - What is the monthly or yearly growth of entries in key business tables (such as orders, transactions, users, etc.)?
   - What is the historical trend for the most important metrics in the database?

3. **Relationships:**
   - What foreign key relationships exist between tables (e.g., which tables reference customers or products)?
   - Which tables are most commonly joined together in queries?

4. **Data completeness and quality:**
   - Which tables have the highest percentage of missing or NULL values in critical columns?
   - Are there tables that appear to have duplicate rows or lack unique keys?

5. **Entity profiling:**
   - What are the most common values in key categorical fields (e.g., status, type, location)?
   - What is the distribution of numerical fields (e.g., min, max, average sales or revenue)?
   - Who are the top customers, products, or users by frequency or revenue?

6. **Anomalies and exceptions:**
   - Which records, if any, have surprising or outlier values (such as negative amounts, future dates, very high/low values)?
   - What proportion of transactions fall outside expected ranges?

7. **Data change over time:**
   - How has the volume of records changed over the past quarters/years?
   - What is the typical lifecycle or retention period for records in key tables?

8. **Coverage/gaps**
   - Are there entities present in one table but missing related data in another due to missing foreign keys or unfulfilled relationships?

If you share sample table names and columns, I can provide even more tailored questions or example SQL queries!
