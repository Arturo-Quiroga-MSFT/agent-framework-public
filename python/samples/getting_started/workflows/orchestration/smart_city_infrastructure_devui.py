Smart City Infrastructure Workflow - DevUI Version with Tracing

This workflow creates a specialized team of 7 smart city experts to analyze
urban infrastructure projects, IoT implementations, and sustainable city initiatives.

The workflow uses a fan-out/fan-in pattern where:
- User describes a smart city project or initiative
- Input is dispatched to all 7 specialized agents concurrently
- Each agent provides domain-specific analysis
- Results are aggregated and formatted with clear sections

SMART CITY AGENTS:
- Urban Planning: Zoning, land use, community impact, density
- IoT & Technology: Sensors, connectivity, data platforms, edge computing
- Sustainability: Green energy, carbon footprint, circular economy
- Transportation: Traffic flow, public transit, autonomous vehicles
- Municipal Finance: Bonds, public-private partnerships, grants, ROI
- Community Engagement: Stakeholder input, equity, accessibility
- Privacy & Security: Data governance, surveillance ethics, cybersecurity

PREREQUISITES:
- Azure OpenAI access configured via .env file in workflows directory
- Azure CLI authentication: Run 'az login'

TRACING OPTIONS:
1. Console Tracing: Set ENABLE_CONSOLE_TRACING=true (simplest)
2. Azure AI Tracing: Set ENABLE_AZURE_AI_TRACING=true (requires Application Insights)
3. OTLP Tracing: Set OTLP_ENDPOINT (e.g., http://localhost:4317 for Jaeger/Zipkin)
4. DevUI Tracing: Set ENABLE_DEVUI_TRACING=true (view in DevUI interface)
